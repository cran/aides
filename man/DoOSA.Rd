\description{
\strong{DoOSA()} is a function for conducting observed sequential analysis.
}
\details{
\enumerate{
\item Basic information for the function \strong{DoOSA()}:
\strong{DoOSA()} supports observed sequential analysis of aggregate data synthesis
based on head-to-head comparison using either binary or continuous data in
each group. Minimum information for the function \strong{DoOSA()} encompasses a data
set of study-level data, and time sequence. Operative points of using function
\strong{DoOSA()} are listed below:
}

1.1. Parameter \code{data} should be used for assigning a data set.

1.2. Study-level data have to be assigned according to outcome type:

1.2.1. \strong{For dichotomous outcome}: Parameter \code{n1} and \code{n2} should be defined
with parameter \code{r1} and \code{r2}.

1.2.2. \strong{For continuous outcome}: parameter \code{n1} and \code{n2} should be defined
with parameter \code{m1}, \code{sd1}, \code{m2}, \code{sd2}.

1.3. Parameter \code{source} and \code{time} are required for doing observed sequential
analysis. Other parameters are auxiliary.
\enumerate{
\item Default in the function \strong{DoOSA()}
Certain defaults have been elucidated in the introductory section about the
parameters, but some of them need to be elaborated upon due to their complexity.
}

2.1. Default on the parameter \code{measure} is \code{"ES"} that automatically uses risk
ratio ("RR") for binary outcome and mean difference ("MD") for continuous
outcome respectively. Argument \code{"OR"} and \code{"SMD"} can be used for the parameter
\code{measure} when original analysis pools data based on odds ratio or standardized
mean difference.

2.2. Default on the parameter \code{method} is \code{"DL"} for applying DerSimonian-Laird
heterogeneity estimator in the original pooled analysis. Other eligible arguments
for the parameter are \code{"REML"} for restricted maximum-likelihood estimator,
\code{"PM"} for Paule-Mandel estimator, \code{"ML"} for maximum-likelihood estimator,
\code{"HS"} for Hunter-Schmidt estimator, \code{"SJ"} for Sidik-Jonkman estimator,
\code{"HE"} for Hedges estimator, and \code{"EB"} for empirical Bayes estimator.

2.3. Default on the parameter \code{pooling} is \code{"IV"} for applying inverse variance
weighting method. Other commonly-used and eligible arguments for the parameter
are \code{"MH"} for Mantel-Haenszel method and \code{"Peto"} for pooling data using Peto
method. The arguments \code{"MH"} and \code{"Peto"} are exclusively available for binary
outcomes, while the argument \code{"IV"} will be automatically applied in the case
of continuous outcomes.

2.4. Default on the parameter \code{adjust} is \code{"D2"} for adjusting optimal information
size (OIS) based on diversity (D-squared statistics). Other eligible arguments
for the parameter are \code{"None"} for the OIS without adjustment, \code{"I2"} for adjusted
OIS based on I-squared statistics, \code{"CHL"} for adjusted OIS based on low
heterogeneity by multiplying 1.33, \code{"CHM"} for adjusted OIS by multiplying 2
due to moderate heterogeneity, and \code{"CHL"} for adjusted OIS by multiplying 4
due to high heterogeneity.
